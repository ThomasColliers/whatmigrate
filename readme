whatmigrate is a tool to help you with migrating your old data to a new 
torrent after a trump. It helps you with file renaming and will try and repad
the files if the filesizes to match to try and make your data pass (most of) 
the hash check. It is mostly targetted at FLAC torrents but may work with other 
files.

Please note that this is still experimental, your results may vary.

There are 2 modes in which the script can operate:
- Automatic mode: this will scan your torrent client (currently only rtorrent
is supported) for unregistered torrents and will aid you to find and migrate 
to the new torrent.
- Manual mode: in this mode you specify a folder you wish to migrate.

The script will run through a procedure which goes something like this:
- Ask for a torrent-file to migrate to or do a site search and download the file
- Suggest a file renaming pattern
- If the filesizes don't match, try and repad the files 
- Do a hash check
- If it fails, suggest a deep hash check to look for possible compatibility (experimental and slow)
- Offer to remove the old torrent from the client (if you have configured the torrent)
- Offer to execute the migration (if the hash check was succesfull)
- Offer to remove the old data
- Add the new torrent to your client (if you have configured the torrent client)

Installation/usage:
- Extract and/or place the files wherever you like
- Run whatmigrate.py
- Edit the configuration-file created in ~/.whatmigrate, only the outputdir is required
